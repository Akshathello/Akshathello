Hii Akshat here !!!!

Currently i am student pursing a Bachelors in Commerce, lately i have been looking into the spheres of programming and in summary it has been an exhilarating journey till now.
I am hoping to start my own project soon, just to get started and hone my skill set. 

I am always looking forward to getting to know new skills and if percieved as interesting then i may even develop intent to learn that skill.

like currently i am into Java Script and aspire to grow the basis of my knowledge in this sphere.
